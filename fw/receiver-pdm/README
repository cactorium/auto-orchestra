# Build instructions
So it looks like I messed up a bit and picked an MCU that isn't very well supported.
So you'll need the latest (3.6.2) AVR toolchain for whatever platform you're on.
If you're on Linux, that'd be something like http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/avr8-gnu-toolchain-3.6.2.1759-linux.any.x86_64.tar.gz
I'll probably package for Arch Linux eventually.
Anyways, you'll need to fix the path in the Makefile to point towards the right toolchain.

It looks like this toolchain is still missing something called crtattiny412.o, so I downloaded a random copy off the Internet and it seems to be working.
Hopefully this won't be required later.

The ATtiny412's definitely an interesting MCU.
It's got an AVR core with PIC-style peripherals.
I really prefer the old style Atmel peripherals over PIC, so I probably should've looked a little closer at the datasheet before picking this guy.
